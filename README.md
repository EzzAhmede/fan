In 1996, a blizzard hit southern Sweden, blocking roads, stopping trains and stopping electricity in some areas.
 On the first day, I could not leave my place of residence and reach my university, so I sat in front of the TV listening to the news and the stories of the doctors who went to the hospital on skis.
 On the second day, I left the house, but the number of trains was less than half of the daily number. On my way back, I stood waiting for the train in the city center.  I waited, then waited, and the number of people waiting with me increased, and it became clear to everyone that the next train would not suffice those waiting.
 When the train came, I tried to approach its door to get on, but a woman in her forties pushed me and shouted foolishly at me.
 Unwilling to jostle with people, I decided to turn away and wait for another train, but getting out of the crowd was as difficult as getting on the train, and in those minutes that I spent walking away from the train, women pushed me, men pushed me, and I heard angry words that I was not used to hearing from polite Swedes.
 As I looked at the departing train, I remembered the transportation of Baghdad and the running of people, and I remembered that this daily situation was one of the things I hated in Iraq, and it always prompted me to ask the reason that prevents us from lining up in a civilized queue!
 That day in southern Sweden taught me that urbanization has many foundations, and it is not achieved in cases of defending existence or running to a train that may not come.
 All these thoughts come to my mind these days, as I review myself, my thoughts, and my beliefs, and I find myself imagining, day after day, that comparing an Iraqi, Egyptian, or Syrian person to a Swedish, Norwegian, or English person is unfair.
 The correct comparison is a comparison of one circumstance with another. For someone who lives in a state of peace for fifty years and was born in a country where his great-grandfathers criticized the rule of the Church is not like someone who lives under bombs and the control of reactionary thought.
 It is not correct to say that human beings are ignorant and backward - it is correct to ask if human beings have schools and education.
 It is not true to say that a group of people is unable to accept other cultures - it is correct to ask if people from that group have had the opportunity to mix with cultures.
 Personally, I believe that the responsibility for improving conditions lies with the human being, but it is not correct to accuse the human being of ignorance and backwardness, and then demand that he bear the responsibility!
